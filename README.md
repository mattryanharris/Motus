# Motus

### What is Motus?
Emotional messaging analytics for those with Aspergers.  It determines emotions conveyed over text and also displays how confident it is about that rating.  Texting can be quite complicated for someone on the spectrum and this hopes to help give more context to conversations and make texting less difficult.  

### More Info
Motus was built by Julian Tith, Saif Ali Karedia, and myself at UC Berkeley's Cal Hacks (2016).
